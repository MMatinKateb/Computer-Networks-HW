In this HW we implmented client/server sockets using both TCP and UDP protocols via Python.

## How Client/Server programs work:
    1 - Client-side user enters the server's hostname and server-side program's port.
    2 - Client enters a string as input message.
    3 - The message will be sent to server-side program with UTF-8 encoding.
    4 - The server converts the message into uppercase and sends it back to client.

Make sure the server program is running with a specific port number.
